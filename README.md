# An Exercise Tracker built using the MERN stack and Tailwindcss

MERN stack is a popular stack made up of MongoDB, Express, React and Nodejs. In addition, Tailwindcss was added to the project because of faster designs and I recently started using it so I'm using it more to really get a hand on it and become proficient in the use of the framework

## How long will the project take ?

In this project, I have already created an exercise tracker but the user-interface wasn't all that and I have new Implementaions I'll like to add, so how long it'll take I'm not too sure but when it's done I'll add the section like this at the end of the README.md file titled 'How long did it take ?'.

## Why an Exercise Tracker

To be Honest, I'm really just trying to make things and get better, consider it 'leveling up' and I feel a project like the exercise-tracker with it's CRUD functionality at the backend and the designs on the frontend I'll get better, I feel.

Note: Howard Otuya is in charge.

Hope the project comes out well to be honest.
